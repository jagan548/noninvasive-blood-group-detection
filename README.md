# 🩸 Non-Invasive Blood Group Detection Using CNN

This project predicts blood group from fingerprint images using a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN).  
The application is developed using **Streamlit** for the user interface and **TensorFlow/Keras** for deep learning.

## 🚀 Features

- Upload fingerprint image (PNG, JPG, JPEG, BMP)
- AI-based blood group prediction
- Confidence percentage display
- Detailed probability breakdown for all blood groups
- Clean and interactive Streamlit UI
- Model caching for faster performance

## 🧠 How It Works

1. The user uploads a fingerprint image.
2. The image is converted to grayscale and resized to 128x128 pixels.
3. The trained CNN model analyzes fingerprint patterns.
4. The system predicts one of the 8 blood groups:
   - A+
   - A-
   - B+
   - B-
   - AB+
   - AB-
   - O+
   - O-
5. The prediction and confidence score are displayed.
